# Lab 8 - Starter
1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
   - Within the Recipe project development pipeline, automated tests would be fit into a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed. Out of the three presented options, this is the only one which follows the idea of being an automated test. The other two options require you to manually run the tests, which while being useful, defeats the purpose of the tests being automated. Furthermore, having a GitHub action which runs tests automatically whenever code is pushed would allow you to protect the integrity of your repository as it would bounce back broken code. 
2) Since E2E testing is used to emulate a user interacting with your website, you would not use E2E testing to determine if a function is returning the expected value.
3) I would utilize a unit test to test the 'message' feature of a messaging application. A unit test would allow you to check and see if a message is able to be sent through to another user in a very isolated case. Since there is a "success" and a "failure" aspect to this feature, a unit test would make sense.
4) A unit test would be appropriate to test a 'max message length' feature. In this unit test, we could attempt to add 81 characters to the message box and then check to see if the message box has 80 characters.
